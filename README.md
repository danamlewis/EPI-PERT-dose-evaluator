This is a simple website used on Github pages to show people whether their total meal dose is high or low relative to the guidelines, and contextualize possible actions as a result of whether they have symptoms or not with this dosing. It is not intended to be medical advice but to inform people and contribute to more informed conversations between patients and healthcare providers. Use at your own risk.
